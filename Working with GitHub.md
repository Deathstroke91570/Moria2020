# Guide to contributing to this project using GitHub

1. Log into your own personal GitHub Account (Create one if necessasry)
2. Navigate to this (Robert-Sheehy/Moria2020) repository. (Link will be made available)
3. Fork the repository by clicking the fork button.
        This creates an up to date copy of the repository on your personal account (YourName/Moria2020) , which you may adjust
        You will notice that it will mention that it was forked from (Robert-Sheehy/Moria2020) and it will also state whether the 
        branch is (even i.e. up to date)  behind (there are edits from other people on main repo, not on your repo) or ahead (where 
        you have changes made that have not been sent to the main repo)
        # Note if your repo is not even with the main repo they will need to be synced (see later....)
4. To work on your repository, you will need to clone onto your machine, this is usually called the local repo, 
      to do this you need the URL of your personal copy of the repo (YourName/Moria2020).
      Clicking the Clone or download gives the option of copying the URL to the clipboard.
      On the desktop, navigate to where you would like to store the local copy
      Right-Click > Git Bash Here
      
      $  git clone (paste url here  use right click as ctrl - v wont work all the time)
      
      You now have a local copy of the repo which you can work on.
